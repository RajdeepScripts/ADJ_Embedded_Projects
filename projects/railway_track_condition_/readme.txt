Smart Railway Track Condition & Environment Monitoring System
Components:
Magnetometer (I2C based)
DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity sensor)
Light Sensor (LDR / BH1750)
 Working:
The magnetometer detects track orientation or vibration changes (if the track slightly tilts or the magnetic field is disturbed).

The DHT11 sensor monitors the surrounding environment (temperature and humidity) to detect rusting, overheating, or other environmental issues.

The light sensor measures light intensity in tunnels or dark zones for safety alerts.
